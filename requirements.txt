# Requirements have been split into separate files for better organization:
# - requirements-core.txt: Essential dependencies
# - requirements-ml.txt: Optional ML/AI dependencies (transformers, torch)
# - requirements-dev.txt: Development dependencies (pytest, linting tools)
#
# To install everything:
#   pip install -r requirements-core.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
#
# For ML features (optional, large downloads):
#   pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
#
# This file is kept for backward compatibility but will be deprecated.
# Please use the split requirements files instead.
